# GroupMe Bot (With PlanetTerp API feature)
This project allows for users to interact with a bot inside to messaging platform GroupMe with a set of prompts. I added additional features that allows the user to retrieve grade data about a specific class at the University of Maryland using the PlanetTerp API.

## How to Run:
Step1: Type "python3 bot.py" in the terminal while inside the project directory \
Step2: Write your message in GroupMe with designated prompt

## Different Prompts:
Prompt 1: "Good Morning" -----> "good morning {NAME}" \
Prompt 2: "Good Night" -----> "good night {NAME}" \
Prompt 3: "Bot, can you give me the average GPA in {CLASS} with professor {NAME}" -----> "Sure! Heres the Average GPA of {COURSE} with Professor {NAME}: {GPA}!"
